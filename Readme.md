# FL Prostate Segmentation and Lesion Detection

**Optimizing Federated Learning Configurations for MRI Prostate Segmentation and Cancer Detection:**  

The method was developed at the [CIMORe](https://www.ntnu.edu/isb/mr-cancer) - Cancer Imaging and Multi-Omics Research Group at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. For detailed information about this method, please read our [SPIE medical imaging conference paper](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12927/129271Q/Federated-learning-for-prostate-cancer-detection-in-biparametric-MRI/10.1117/12.2688568.full) or the [Radiology Artificial Intelligence manuscript](https://www.to_be_add.com). 


Complete details about the implementation and the required software and packages will be made publicly available upon publication of the manuscript (stay tuned...)
