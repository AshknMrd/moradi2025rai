# Federate Learning for  Prostate Segmentation and Lesion Detection

**Optimizing Federated Learning Configurations for MRI Prostate Segmentation and Cancer Detection:**  

In this study, we proposed a federated learning (FL) approach for prostate segmentation on T2-weighted MRI data involving four clients and a total of 1,294 patient cases, as well as for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) on biparametric MRI data (T2W, HBV, and ADC) using three clients and 1,500 patient cases in total (data from [PI-CAI (Prostate Imaging: Cancer AI) grand challenge](https://pi-cai.grand-challenge.org/)). A schematic of the implemented scenarios, including details on data distribution, is presented in the following, prostate segmentation on the left and csPCa detection on the right.

The method was developed at the [CIMORe](https://www.ntnu.edu/isb/mr-cancer) - Cancer Imaging and Multi-Omics Research Group at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. For detailed information about this method, please read our [SPIE medical imaging conference paper](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12927/129271Q/Federated-learning-for-prostate-cancer-detection-in-biparametric-MRI/10.1117/12.2688568.full) or the [Radiology Artificial Intelligence manuscript](https://www.to_be_add.com). 


Complete details about the implementation and the required software and packages will be made publicly available upon publication of the manuscript (stay tuned...)
